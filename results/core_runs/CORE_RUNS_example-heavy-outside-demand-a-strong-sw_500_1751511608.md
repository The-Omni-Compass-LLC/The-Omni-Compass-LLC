Each run: omnicompass/core.simulate, 20 macro steps of 10 fourth-order Runge–Kutta micro steps (Δt 0.1 s a macro step), from the starting state and parameters its own stream draws (seed_k = base + k·0x9E3779B9 mod 2³², mulberry32, the live engine's own generator). Conveyed: 5 macro steps in a row in one basin (|U ∓ 1| ≤ 0.1); certified: 10. Written 2026-10-26T22:01:47Z. Class S.

**Digest 6b6972362e0deaa5fceb40fdcacf40003632a0eea24913a8c8f9081632477175** (SHA-256 of every run's path at six decimals). The live engine's page runs the same set through its own port of the core and shows its own digest beside this one.

**The C++ twin** (`cpp/tools/core_runs.cpp` on `cpp/src/core.cpp`) on the same draws: digest 6b6972362e0deaa5fceb40fdcacf40003632a0eea24913a8c8f9081632477175, the same; 2000 of 2000 run-ways agree to 1e-9, largest difference 0.0e+00. The draws themselves, the injection: SHA-256 af6d4ca727ee4a475cb3dc28d43ed6397f764601c7afdbf409ed716cd5b2f805.

**Your own system: example: heavy outside demand, a strong swing, little headroom.** An example of a system file, not any real stack: the outside demand into E high, the swing of the bath strong and fast, the headroom E_max small, the double well shallow. Its ranges (the rest are the engine's own): beta_ext 0.6 to 1; c 3 to 5; E_max 1 to 3; omega_B 2 to 5; mu 2 to 3.
