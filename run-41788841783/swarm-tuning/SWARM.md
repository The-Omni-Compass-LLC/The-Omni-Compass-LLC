native: every drone's shipped position controller at the planner's cruise; omni: the same, with the compass law on the cruise override inside the autopilot's limits, spending tracking slack as speed. Energy is a declared model (evidence class S) computed the same way for both arms. A cell where native itself collides is void; a collision with Omni-Compass on top is a judged row, any increase a LOSS (amendment 2). Every row is reported.

## tuning: 5 drones x 4 missions, 3 to 8 m (the tuning swarm)

Paired physics trial (native, uncounted): 498 J a mission at the planner's cruise, 446 J at 1.25 x; a faster mission is cheaper and inside the safe error, so omni may move the cruise.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | direction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| energy per mission (J, declared model: motors and avionics over the fleet window) | 456.3 | 398.1 | -12.74% | spent |
| fleet energy over the window (J, declared model) | 9125 | 7962 | -12.74% | spent |
| missions per charge at the autopilot's reserve | 5.839 | 6.692 | +14.60% | higher |
| missions over their deadline (share) | 0 | 0 | +0.000 | never more |
| drones that broke the battery reserve | 0 | 0 | +0.000 | never more |
| control ticks with two drones under half the keep-out apart (near misses) | 0 | 0 | +0.000 | never more |
| control ticks with two drones under two collision radii (collisions) | 0 | 0 | +0.000 | never more |
| closest two drones ever came (m) | 0.3717 | 0.3984 | +7.19% | shown |
| tracking error, RMS (m; the compass's reading, held inside its band) | 0.07381 | 0.1177 | +59.49% | shown |
| mission time (s) | 18.46 | 15.38 | -16.70% | shown |
| seconds airborne per mission | 18.44 | 15.36 | -16.72% | shown |
| cruise override, mean | 1 | 1.345 | +34.53% | shown |

Missions flown: native 20, omni 20; cut off: 0 / 0; every override handed back: native True, omni True; collisions 0 / 0.
