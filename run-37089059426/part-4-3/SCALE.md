# Six organisms, 100 runs, 1x size

Evidence class **S** (models). Commit `e0294a584531`, seeds 7000-7099, 1 copy of each organism on one clock, 65 s on 4 workers. Native: each organism's own controllers. Omni: the bowl law on every muscle (`realms/bowl_arm.py`). Harness `tools/run_scale.py`.

Band first (the founder's rule): no win unless the time over the service line is no higher than native's (violations, mean over runs, at or under 0 pp).
